    <p>The modern web is no fun. It's all about being minimal, working on mobile phones, and throwing in as much metadata as possible. That's fine for this site's homepage that most people see, but here's my real homepage. Just don't tell anyone.</p>

    <h2>How this works...</h2>
    <p>Since all professionalism has been abandoned for this part of my site, nothing is particularly organized. I have different topics that I'm interested here with links to other pages and random pieces of information. This is my website, but it's also
        my obnoxious maze. >:D</p>

    <h3>Macs</h3>

    <img src="images/mac1.GIF" />
    <p>Retro Macs are awesome, and so are modern ones. I'm the proud user of several Macs, and it's been my platform of choice for a while.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My main Mac is a 2017 MacBook, featuring 8 gigs of RAM, a 512 gig SSD, and a Core i7. It's not a powerhouse but it does all I need it to and more.</li>
        <li>I almost use my 2014 Mac mini as much as my MacBook. It has a Core i5 and 8 gigs of RAM, but also a 1 terabyte SSD. It's also a great little computer.</li>
        <li>Finally, I have a PowerBook 520 from 1994 that still sort of works! Not bad considering I got it for free.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pebbles</h3>
    <p>Like any other extreme tech nerd, I still wear Pebble smartwatches. Currently, I have quite a few:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pebble Time Round with <a href="ptr.html">new battery</a></li>
        <li>Mint red Pebble Time and a scratched black Time, both work</li>
        <li>Silver Pebble Steel, also working</li>
        <li>Several original Pebbles, only two work</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Music</h3>

    <img src="images/cd2.GIF" />
    <p>I also like music, just like any other remotely-normal person. Here's some stuff related to that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="music.html">Recommendations</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">CDs, Records, and Cassettes</a></li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Cameras</h3>
    <p>I went through a photography phase at one point. These are my three main cameras:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lumix ZS70</li>
        <li>Kodak Cameo Motor EX</li>
        <li>iPhone 12</li>
    </ul>

        <li><a href="zombies.html">Disney Zombies Essay/Rant</a></li>
    </ul>
